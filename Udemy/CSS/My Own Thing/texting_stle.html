        As stated in an interview with original series creator Hideki Kamiya in the Devil May Cry Graphic Edition
        artbook, the earliest ideas he had for Dante's design were centered around three key points; "[a] long, stylish
        coat" to make the character "showy", "[a] British man" as Kamiya wanted him to be a "witty, yet traditional
        fighting man", and "doesn't smoke cigarette[s]", believing that the character was too cool to smoke.[5]
    </p>
    <p>
        In the same interview, another noted influence on Dante both design-wise and character-wise was Cobra of the
        acclaimed Japanese manga and anime series Space Adventure Cobra. Kamiya believed Cobra's cocky attitude and red
        attire were key points for a "heroic" character. Ironically, despite Cobra being a heavy cigar smoker, Dante
        himself does not smoke, as Kamiya believed Dante to be cooler without a cigarette.[5]

        Ever since Devil May Cry started development as Resident Evil 4,[6] Dante has had white hair. It's remained in a
        consistent style throughout the series, although there are a few differences between installments.
    </p>
    <p>
        In Devil May Cry, Devil May Cry 4 and Devil May Cry 5, his hair is somewhat parted with his bangs brushed down;
    </p>
    <p>
        in Devil May Cry 3 his hair is brushed down with his bangs partially covering his eyes, and in Devil May Cry 2
        his hair is much thicker, with his bangs parted in front of his right eye.

    </p> Dante has worn a myriad of clothing throughout his many appearances, yet his most glaring trait is his affinity
    for red-colored apparel, often in the form of long, two-tailed coats.
    </p>
    <p>
        In Devil May Cry 3, Dante wears long, tan-colored jeans, black fingerless gloves, and military-style boots. His
        coat has zippers on the sleeves and a buckle around the waist, and two brown, leather holsters on the back to
        carry Ebony & Ivory. Contrary to later games, Dante does not wear any form of clothing underneath his coat,
        going shirtless throughout the whole game, displaying his silver half of the Perfect Amulet around his neck, as
        well as his bare, well-toned chest and muscular physique. Following Dante's first battle with Vergil, his half
        of the amulet is stolen and the right sleeve of his coat is damaged, with Dante tearing it off afterward. In his
        final confrontation with Vergil, his left glove is slashed across the palm by Yamato, and the epilogue shows
        that Dante keeps it on his desk, perhaps in remembrance of his lost brother.
    </p>
    <p>
        In the original Devil May Cry and the anime adaptation, Dante wears red pants with two black belts wrapped
        around his right thigh, a black, leather belt, black gloves, and high, black boots. Dante's coat is much basic
        in design, with an upturned collar and short sleeves with black cuffs, though the coat lacks coattails.
        Underneath the coat, Dante wears what appears to be a black long-sleeved shirt, with a red vest with black
        clasps over it. In numerous cutscenes, his half of the Perfect Amulet is once again on display, yet it appears
        infrequently and is not a permanent feature on his character model.
    </p>
    <p>
        In Devil May Cry 2, Dante's outfit is reminiscent of the one seen in the first game, but with more pronounced
        and poignant features. He wears high black boots and red jeans once more, yet has a single belt wrapped around
        each thigh. A belt featuring a skull-themed buckle wraps around his waist, and he wears black, gauntlet shaped
        gloves with three buckled straps on each one. His coat is a deeper red than in the previous game, with two
        coattails, yet the coat has a more pronounced buckled collar and a black strap going over his right shoulder
        wrapping around his chest, with two golden studs on the front. The front of the coat is also patterned
        individually from the rest of it, resembling a sort of vest or body armor, with a zipper closed all the way up
        from the waist to the bottom of Dante's neck, perhaps reflecting his introverted nature seen in the game.
    </p>
    <p>
        In his appearance in Devil May Cry 4, Dante's outfit arguably takes on its most flamboyant look. Dante once more
        wears red pants, yet they are almost completely covered sans his crotch and rear by long, black leather
        motorcycle chaps featuring a brown, cowboy boot design around the ankles. He wears black, loafer looking boots,
        and black gloves exposing his knuckles and index finger on each hand, and his pants are wrapped with a black
        belt featuring a silver emblem decorated with a demonic skull. The coat is given a much more detailed and
        stylish look, with Western and Italian features, and a deep red, almost crimson color. Once more the coat is
        short-sleeved, with numerous gold-colored studs decorating the shoulders, collar, and chest, and a single zipper
        on the front, yet Dante is never seen zipping it up in-game. Underneath the coat, Dante wears a black, zipped up
        undershirt with three clasps closed together with ornate, golden buckles, and medium-length sleeves that can be
        seen passing his shoulders. This undershirt is also zipped up just below his neck and features an upturned
        collar which complements the one on his coat. Another noticeable design choice separate from Dante's outfit is
        his chin, covered with short, black stubble, reflecting his older age, as stated by designer Tatsuya Yoshikawa
        in the Devil May Cry: 3142 Graphic Arts book that Dante is "around 40" by the events of Devil May Cry
        4.[7][excerpt 1]
    </p>
    <p>
        In Devil May Cry 5, Dante's outfit takes on its most simple look. His red jacket is faded, has a washed-out
        look, a skull on his back and also resembles his Devil May Cry 4 jacket. He wears an ordinary black Henley
        T-shirt with three buttons as the sleeves itself reach through his elbows, where it also features torn details,
        for his wrists he wears black driving gloves and white bandages. For his legs, he wears a black belt with golden
        accents, black leather pants, and brown boots. His hair and beard also grow after being in a coma for a month.
        This gives Dante a more grungy look. Dante's black Henley T-Shirt also appears dark blue during the daylight
        when he battles Vergil during their duel and their sparring match in the epilogue.
    </p>
    <p>
        Following his defeat by Urizen, Dante's hair had grown out considerably during his recovery and is now the same
        length as it was in Devil May Cry 2, albeit styled similarly to that in Devil May Cry. Along with his hair, from
        stubble to beard. His clothes are also muted in color and dirtier as well.
