                Thank you for bringing love, acceptance and joy into my life all these years. All of the lessons you've tuaght me over the years have added up to the wonderful life I'm living today.
                I'm grateful for you, Dad and I'm not sure I'll ever be able to pay you back for all that you've done for me. No matter where I go in life, you'll always be my number one man. &#x1F61C&#128512

            Despite everything I've put you through you still keep on loving me, keeping me around and lifting me up when I fall.
            I know i Haven't been the easiest person to deal with but I am really and truly thankful that in spite of all the bad things I've done you still haven't stopped being my father.
            You are indeed the only man worthy of being called my father and I am thankful that Heavenly Father has entrusted me to you! Thank you fro your inspiration, your teachings and for just being you.
            I definitely could not have asked for a better Father! Love you for eternity, old man! &#128519&#x1F601&#128142
