                I've basically been a member of the Church since I was born, so I was baptised at age 8. I served a mission in SACTM (South Africa Cape Town Mission) from August 2012 to August 2014. I am currently serving as the very first Elders Quorum President in the newly Established Lydenburg Branch (Since August 2020) and I am no longer employed, giving me ample time to work on my studies.

                I developed an interest in Programming in August 2019. Prior to that I wished to pursue mechanical engineering as a major, specifically fitting and machining. However, due to the fact that I am visually imparied, as well as having to relocate, I became increasing disadvantaged and eventually I gave up on it completely. This was in 2017. 3 years later, my dad informs me that one of his colleagues just got transferred to the head office of the company he's working for to work as a programmer. It was then that I started to make some inquires, which led me to purchase an independent study course on Udemy, which happens to be about Web Development. When I began that course, I had no idea what to expect, but man was everything extremely easy to understand and follow along with! As I sat coding along with the instruction videos I just fell in love with coding and programming! It was during that time that I then felt impressed to start doing PathwayConnect. In 2017, I attempted to do Pathway but because there were no virtual gatherings at the time I could not. But I remember looking at the courses on the BYU-I website and saw that Software engineering was on the list. While I was doing my independent study course, I began to recollect this information and thus began my PathwayConnect journey, and here I am now. 1 year later. It's been an incredible journey and I absolutely loved doing Python last semester! I'm looking forward to doing it again during the second half of this semester. I have not yet completed my independent study course but am hoping to get enough headway so I can maintain my advantage as far as web development goes. As for what I desire to major in, so far I'd love major in data science and machine learning. I am feeling rather strongly drawn to that. Web and app development is fun too though and so far I am thoroughly enjoying it, especially when it comes to styling web pages. I's also maybe like to go into game design. But definitely data science and machine learning. That is what I feel drawn to most, followed by developing websites and maybe applications too.

                As you can see, I have some experience with HTML and CSS, so I have a bit of an advantage here. Hahaha! I don't know everything, but if you do need a hand, I'm here.
                I am looking forward to working with you and to being a part of this class. If you have any questions about my disability or anything else about me, do not hesitate to ask! I have nothing to hide!
